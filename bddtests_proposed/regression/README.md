## regression
Regression Test Suites, comprised of a list of tests and supporting configuration scripts and infrastructure files,
using any of a variety of languages such as 
[GO](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bddtests/regression/go), 
[NODE](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bddtests/regression/node), 
etc. Note: a flexible-use performance engine, which can be configured and used for a variety of tests, is located in the 
[node/performance](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bddtests/regression/node/performance) folder.
For examples how to use it, check there, and in the daily test suite and long-run test suite.
